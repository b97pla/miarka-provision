README
=======

The README describes the content of the delivered data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Samples were analysed with the Sarek pipeline release {{ release }}. In short, the pipeline does the following:
Reads from fastq-files were mapped to a reference genome using BWA.
Bam-files were de-duplicated with GATK MarkDuplicates.
Base quality score recalibration tables were created with GATK BaseRecalibrator. 
The tables were then used in GATK ApplyBQSR to create recalibrated bam-files.
SNVs and small indels were called with GATK HaplotypeCaller.
Variants were annoted with SnpEff.

For details on the pipeline, folder structure and how to interpret results, please refer to the Sarek documentation:
https://nf-co.re/sarek/{{ release }}

Root level
----------
The root folder, which is named by the project id, contains one report folder,
one resource folder and one folder for each sample. Each sample folder is
accompanied by a .lst-file containing a list of the files in the folder and
a .md5-file containing the MD5-checksums of the files in the folder.
Use the MD5-checksums to verify the integrity of the files after transfer.

   |--Sample1.md5
   |--Sample2

   |--SampleN
   |--SampleN.lst
   |--SampleN.md5

====================================================================
ProjectID -> 00-Reports
====================================================================
00-Reports contain sequence QC for flowcells and a project report.

{% if site == "upps" %}
      |--ProjectID_multiqc_report_data.zip
      |--SequenceQC
{% endif %}

--ProjectID_multiqc_report.html
A project report summarizing the included samples and results from the sequencing and analysis.

{% if site == "upps" %}
--ProjectID_multiqc_report_data.zip
Source data for the project report.

--SequenceQC
The SequenceQC folder contain sequence QC data, which provide information about the
quality and other features of the fastq-files. The reports are organized by sequence run.

{% endif %}
====================================================================
ProjectID -> 01-Resources
====================================================================
01-Resources contain helper scripts and other resources

      |--apply_recalibration.sh

--apply_recalibration.sh
Variant calling has been performed after recalibrating the base quality
scores of this BAM file (BQSR). However, due to the drastic increase in file
size during base quality recalibration, the BAM file without recalibrated
base quality scores is delivered. If recalibrated base qualities are required
for downstream applications, this script can be used to obtain a recalibrated BAM file.

Note: The BAM file and recalibration table can be found among the sarek results,
read more below.

====================================================================
ProjectID -> SampleN
====================================================================
Each sample will contain a results folder:

{% if "sthlm" == site %}
|--ProjectID
   |--SampleN
      |--results
         |--PipelineTool1
         |--PipelineTool2
         ...
         ...
         |--PipelineToolN
{% endif %}
{% if "upps" == site %}

Top level folders:

Annotation:     Variant calls annotated with e.g. transcript information and predicted variant effects
pipeline_info:  Information about pipeline and software versions
Preprocessing:  BAM files with duplicates marked and tables for performing recalibration with GATK
Reports:        Statistics and QC from various tools. 
VariantCalling: VCF and GVCF files containing e.g. SNVs, CNVs, small indels and structural variants.   

This folder contains output from the sarek pipeline. Refer to
https://nf-co.re/sarek/{{ release }}/docs/output for more detailed output description.

====================================================================
FASTQS
====================================================================
FASTQ files are not included in the delivery, but can be regenerated from the BAM files.
We recommend using https://github.com/qbic-pipelines/bamtofastq, refer to its documentation
for usage.
